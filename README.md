Socket Programming in Python
Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection. Server forms the listener socket while client reaches out to the server.
They are the real backbones behind web browsing. In simpler terms there is a server and a client.
Sockets are the endpoints of a bidirectional communications channel. Sockets may communicate within a process, between processes on the same machine, or between processes on different continents.
Sockets may be implemented over a number of different channel types: Unix domain sockets, TCP, UDP, and so on. The socket library provides specific classes for handling the common transports as well as a generic interface for handling the rest.

Server :
A server has a bind() method which binds it to a specific ip and port so that it can listen to incoming requests on that ip and port. A server has a listen() method which puts the server into listen mode. This allows the server to listen to incoming connections. And last a server has an accept() and close() method. The accept method initiates a connection with the client and the close method closes the connection with the client

Simple Client
Let us write a very simple client program which opens a connection to a given port 12345 and given host. This is very simple to create a socket client using Pythonâ€™s socket module function.
The socket.connect(hosname, port ) opens a TCP connection to hostname on the port. Once you have a socket open, you can read from it like any IO object. When done, remember to close it, as you would close a file.
